# Overview

This is a template of a social app that allows you to look for different events nearby created by other people in order to socialize more and spend time together with strangers that could potentially become friends.

Disclaimer: It is not a fully working project. This repo should rather serve as an example of how to structure an Android project with MVVM architecture, work with different frameworks like Dagger2 or RxJava+Firestore, create basic UI and unit tests and more.
